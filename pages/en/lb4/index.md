## Built for API developers

 - Define your API endpoints and schemas using the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard.
 - Write your endpoints in modern JavaScript using ES2017, `async` / `await`, modules.
 - Use your defined endpoints and schemas as the source of truth without generating code.

## Built for teams

 - Review changes to API endpoints without digging through JavaScript.
 - Maintain consistency by automating the validation of your endpoints and schemas.
 - First class support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) (strongly typed JavaScript).

## Built for your platform

 - Use LoopBack as a starting point for your own framework or platform.
 - Build libraries of reusable components in a standardized way.
 - Integrate with databases, web services, and other platforms using connectors.
